# WebBrowser in Java
Travis Stratton

This is a simple web application which involves setting up several browsers within a single JFrame.
This functionality allows for the movement of each window acorss the panel so that it conforms to the window.
Now, if you need two side by side web pages, you can get it in the same window without having to launch a second
instance of the browser.
